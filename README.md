# Astro + WordPress Integration

This project synchronizes the backend of WordPress with a static site built using [Astro](https://astro.build). WordPress acts as a headless CMS, while the frontend is served statically using Astro.

The integration is set up with GitHub Actions, which allows the site to be deployed automatically via FTP whenever a new post is created or updated in the WordPress backend. When a new post is created, an event is triggered that initiates the deployment process.

This approach separates the backend of WordPress as a CMS while the fast, SEO-friendly static frontend is provided by Astro.
